    <h2>1. Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      The array you are given represents the menu of breakfast options available at the hotel. <br />
      The Chef decided to replace one of the options with "Fluffy Pancakes". <br />
      Write a program to take the index as input, replace the element with that index with "Fluffy
      Pancakes", and output the new menu to the console as an array.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Check the result in browser's console</p>

    <br />
    <h2>2. Other Ways to Create Arrays</h2>
    <p>There are other ways to create arrays. Check the browser's console to see all the methods.</p>
    <p>
      JavaScript arrays are dynamic, so you can declare an array and not pass any arguments with the
      Array() constructor. You can then add the elements dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
      For greater simplicity, readability, and execution speed, you can also declare arrays using the array
      literal syntax.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>3. Array Properties</h2>
    <p>JavaScript's concat() method allows you to join arrays and create an entirely new array.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console to see a sample.</p>

    <br />
    <h2>4. Associative Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      While many programming languages support arrays with named indexes (text instead of numbers), called
      associative arrays JavaScript does not. However, you still can use the named array syntax, which will
      produce an object.

    <h2>5. The Math Object</h2>
    <p>The Math object allows you to perform mathematical tasks, and includes several properties.</p>
    <p>Create a function that returns the century depending on the year given as a parameter.</p>
