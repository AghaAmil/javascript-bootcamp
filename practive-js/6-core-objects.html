    <h2>1. Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      The array you are given represents the menu of breakfast options available at the hotel. <br />
      The Chef decided to replace one of the options with "Fluffy Pancakes". <br />
      Write a program to take the index as input, replace the element with that index with "Fluffy
      Pancakes", and output the new menu to the console as an array.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Check the result in browser's console</p>

    <br />
    <h2>Other Ways to Create Arrays</h2>
    <p>There are other ways to create arrays. Check the browser's console to see all the methods.</p>
    <p>
      JavaScript arrays are dynamic, so you can declare an array and not pass any arguments with the
      Array() constructor. You can then add the elements dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
      For greater simplicity, readability, and execution speed, you can also declare arrays using the array
      literal syntax.
