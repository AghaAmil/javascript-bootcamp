    <h2>1. Introducing Objects</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript variables are containers for data values. <b>Objects</b> are variables too, but they can
      contain many values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of an object as a list of values that are written as <b>name:value</b> pairs, with the names
      and the values separated by colons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> A sample object is created in the browser's console. <br />
      <b>Note:</b> access object properties in the browser's console.
    </p>
    <p>
      The given class represents a cuboid (e.g. a rectangular prism) that contains the properties of
      length, width, and height. Complete the program to calculate and output the volume of given cuboid to
      the console.
    </p>
    <p>
      length: 10<br />
      height: 13<br />
      width: 7<br />
      The volume of the cuboid is: <b><span id="sp1"></span></b>
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>2. The Object Constructor</h2>
    <p>
      In the examples above, we created an object using the <b>object literal</b> (or initializer) syntax.
      <br />
      Sometimes, we need to set an "object type" that can be used to create a number of objects of a single
      type. <br />
      The standard way to create an "object type" is to use an <b>object constructor</b> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Check the browser's console for the created objects using object constructor fucntion
    </p>

      Bob was hired as an airport information officer and needs to generate status messages for each
      flight․ Let’s help him! Complete the given program by fixing the constructor, making a flight object,
      and assign it to given variable to correctly execute the corresponding message. Flight ID and the
      flight status(landed, on time, delayed, etc.) are taken as input.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sample Input:</b> <br />
      NGT 929 <br />
      Landed
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sample Output</b> <br />
      <span id="sp2"></span>
    </p>
