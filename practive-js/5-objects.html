    <h2>1. Introducing Objects</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript variables are containers for data values. <b>Objects</b> are variables too, but they can
      contain many values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of an object as a list of values that are written as <b>name:value</b> pairs, with the names
      and the values separated by colons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> A sample object is created in the browser's console. <br />
      <b>Note:</b> access object properties in the browser's console.
