    <h2>1. Selecting Elements</h2>
    <p>
      All HTML elements are objects. And as we know every object has properties and methods. <br />
      The document object has methods that allow you to select the desired HTML element. <br />
      These three methods are the most commonly used for selecting HTML elements:
    </p>
    <div>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Each element in the DOM has a set of properties and methods that provide information about their
      relationships in the DOM:
    </p>
    <p>A section with some divs and paragraphs is created below, We want to play with it using JS DOM.</p>
    <section>
      <div id="div1">
        <p>Going to be changed by JS in 2 seconds. if you miss it, refresh the page.</p>
        <p>Going to be changed by JS in 2 seconds. if you miss it, refresh the page.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="div2">
        <p>paragraph 3 in div2</p>
        <p>paragraph 4 in div2</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <br />
    <h2>2. Changing Elements</h2>
    <p>Once you have selected the element(s) you want to work with, you can change their attributes.</p>
    <p>
      For example, we can change the src attribute of an image: (the source of the image will be changed in
      3 seconds)
    </p>
    <img src="../image/js-sololearn-1.jpg" alt="image1" id="img1" />
    <br />
    <p>We can change the href attribute of a link:</p>
    <p><a href="https://google.com">This link directs you to Google by default.</a></p>
    <p>
      <button onclick="linkChanger()">Change the href</button>
      <button onclick="linkChangerDefault()">Reset to default link</button>
    </p>
    <p>The style of HTML elements can also be changed using JavaScript.</p>
    <div id="div3">This div contains some information</div>

    <script src="7-dom-and-events.js"></script>
