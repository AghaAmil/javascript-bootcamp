    <h2>1. Selecting Elements</h2>
    <p>
      All HTML elements are objects. And as we know every object has properties and methods. <br />
      The document object has methods that allow you to select the desired HTML element. <br />
      These three methods are the most commonly used for selecting HTML elements:
    </p>
    <div>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
      <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Each element in the DOM has a set of properties and methods that provide information about their
      relationships in the DOM:
    </p>

        <p>Going to be changed by JS in 2 seconds. if you miss it, refresh the page.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="div2">
        <p>paragraph 3 in div2</p>
        <p>paragraph 4 in div2</p>
      </div>
    </section>
