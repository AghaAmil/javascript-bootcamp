        <h2>
            Lesson One <br>
            Getting Started with JavaScript
        </h2>
    </section>

    <section class="main-content">
        <h3>Welcome to JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            Ever visit a website that made you thinkâ€¦"Hey, this website is really cool and interactive"? Well,
            <b>JavaScript</b> was
            probably making it happen....
            In this course, we'll learn the basic concepts of JavaScript - one of the most popular programming languages
            that makes websites dynamic and interactive. With JavaScript, you can also create mobile apps and games,
            process
            data, and much more!
        </p>
        <h3>The Console</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language that runs in web browsers. Most websites use JavaScript and when things
            go
            wrong, web developers use the <b>console</b> to investigate errors.
        </p>
        <div class="blockquote-content">
            <img src="../../img/blockquote-icon.svg" alt="Blockquote Icon" class="bq-logo">
            <blockquote>
                The console is part of the web browser and allows you to log messages, run JavaScript code, and see
                errors and warnings. <br>
                Coding errors are not visible in the browser. Web developers use the <b>console</b> to test code
                and fix bugs.
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>Check the Browser console to observe how <span>console.log</span> is working.</p>
        <h3>
            Logging Messages
        </h3>
        <p>
            The console is part of the web browser. Logging(writing) messages to the console is a good way to
            diagnose and troubleshoot minor issues in your code.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use <span>console.log()</span> to write or log messages. For instance, the message 'All
            good, no errors' is sent to the console.
        </p>
        <div class="blockquote-content">
            <img src="../../img/blockquote-icon.svg" alt="Blockquote Icon" class="bq-logo">
            <blockquote>
                As can be seen in the earlier samples logged in the browser console, text in JavaScript needs to be
                enclosed in <b>quotes</b>. <br>
                Your JavaScript code wonâ€™t work if you donâ€™t include a pair of quotation marks around the text message.
                You can use either <b>single</b> or <b>double</b> quotation marks.
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <h3>
            The Output
        </h3>
        <p>
            You can use the <span>console.log()</span> function as many times as you want. Each statement outputs text
            from a new line.
        </p>
        <div class="blockquote-content">
            <img src="../../img/blockquote-icon.svg" alt="Blockquote Icon" class="bq-logo">
            <blockquote>
                A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer. <br>
                In a programming language, these programming instructions are called <b>statements</b>.
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <h3>
            Numbers
        </h3>
        <p>
            When working with <b>numbers</b>, quotes are not needed. JavaScript treats numbers and text differently -
            you will learn all the subtleties in the upcoming lessons.
            <br>
            Check the browser console to observe how to log numbers.
        </p>

            Lesson Takeaways
        </h3>
        <p>
            Amazing, you have taken the first step! ðŸš€ Let's summarize what you've just learned:
            <br>
            ðŸ’¡<b>The console</b> is part of the web browser and allows you to log messages, run JavaScript code, and see
            errors
            and warnings.
            <br>
            ðŸ’¡<span>console.log()</span> is used to display a text to the console
        </p>
        <h4>What's next?</h4>
        <p>
            In the next lesson, you will learn how to explain your code, how to generate <b>alert boxes</b>, and learn
            about the magic of our <b>Code Playground!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            But now is the time to put your knowledge into practice and write real code by doing the <b>Code Coach
            exercise</b> below.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="exec-content">
        <h3>
            My First Code Coach!
        </h3>
        <p>
            Let's code for real!
            <br>
            The given program should output the text: "Solving my first JavaScript Code Coach!".
            <br>
            Complete the code to generate the required output.
