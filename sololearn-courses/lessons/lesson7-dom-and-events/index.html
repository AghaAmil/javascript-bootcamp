<h2>1. Selecting Elements</h2>
<p>
    All HTML elements are objects. And as we know every object has properties and methods. <br/>
    The document object has methods that allow you to select the desired HTML element. <br/>
    These three methods are the most commonly used for selecting HTML elements:
</p>
<div>
    <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
    <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
    <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
    <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
    <p class="para1">The content of these paragraphs are modified by JS.</p>
</div>
<p>
    Each element in the DOM has a set of properties and methods that provide information about their
    relationships in the DOM:
</p>
<p>A section with some divs and paragraphs is created below, We want to play with it using JS DOM.</p>
<section>
    <div id="div1">
        <p>Going to be changed by JS in 2 seconds. if you miss it, refresh the page.</p>
        <p>Going to be changed by JS in 2 seconds. if you miss it, refresh the page.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div2">
        <p>paragraph 3 in div2</p>
        <p>paragraph 4 in div2</p>
    </div>
</section>
<br/>
<h2>2. Changing Elements</h2>
<p>Once you have selected the element(s) you want to work with, you can change their attributes.</p>
<p>
    For example, we can change the src attribute of an image: (the source of the image will be changed in
    3 seconds)
</p>
<img src="../../img/js-sololearn-1.jpg" alt="image1" id="img1"/>
<br/>
<p>We can change the href attribute of a link:</p>
<p><a href="https://google.com">This link directs you to Google by default.</a></p>
<p>
    <button onclick="linkChanger()">Change the href</button>
    <button onclick="linkChangerDefault()">Reset to default link</button>
</p>
<p>The style of HTML elements can also be changed using JavaScript.</p>
<div id="div3">This div contains some information</div>
<br/>
<h2>3. Adding & Removing Elements</h2>
<h3>Adding Elements</h3>
<p>
    To add a new element to the HTML DOM, you must create the element (element node) first, and then
    append it to an existing element.
</p>
<br/>
<div id="div4">
    This div has some contents including below paragraphs
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div id="div5">This div is going to contain an unordered list with one item inside it.</div>
<br/>
<h3>Removing Elements</h3>
<div id="div6">
    This div has two paragraphs as child. And they are removed with the power of JavaScript.
    <p id="p1">This is the 1st paragraph</p>
    <p id="p2">This is the 2nd paragraph</p>
</div>
<br/>
<h3>Replacing Elements</h3>
<div id="div7">
    We are going to replace the paragraph's of below div to something new:
    <p id="p3">This is the 1st paragraph</p>
    <p id="p4">This is the 2nd paragraph</p>
</div>
<br/>
<h2>4. Creating Animations</h2>
<p>Let's create a simple HTML page with a box element that will be animated using JS.</p>
<p>
    <button onclick="start()">Start</button>
    <!-- <button onclick="reset()">Reset</button> -->
</p>
<div id="container">
    <div id="box"></div>
</div>
<br/>
<h2>5. Handling Events</h2>
<p>
    You can write JavaScript code that executes when an event occurs, such as when a user clicks an HTML
    element, moves the mouse, or submits a form. When an event occurs on a target element, a handler
    function is executed. Common HTML events include:
</p>
<p>
    <button onclick="alert1()">Calling using OnClick</button>
</p>
<p>
    <button id="but1">Calling using Event handler</button>
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page. These can be
    useful when performing actions after the page is loaded.
</p>
<p>
    The onchange event is mostly used on textbox. The event handler gets called when the text inside
    the textbox changes and focus is lost from the element.
</p>
<p>
    <b>For Example:</b>
    <input type="text" id="input1" onchange="change()"/>
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Event Listeners</h3>
<p>
    The <b>addEventListener()</b> method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting
    existing event handlers. You can add many event handlers to one element. <br/>
    You can also add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e., two "click" events.
</p>
<p>
    <button id="but2">CLICK ME</button>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>6. Event Propagation</h2>
<p>There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM: bubbling and capturing.</p>
<p>
    In <b>bubbling</b>, the innermost element's event is handled first and then the outer element's event
    is handled. <br/>
    In <b>capturing</b>, the outermost element's event is handled first and then the inner.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>addEventListener()</b> method allows you to specify the propagation type with the
    <b>"useCapture"</b>
    parameter.
</p>
<p>
    The default value is <b>false</b>, which means the bubbling propagation is used; when the value is
    set to <b>true</b>, the event uses the capturing propagation.
</p>
<p style="color: red"><b>Event Propagation examples will be mentioned later.</b></p>
<br/>
<h2>7. Creating an Image Slider.</h2>
<div>
    <button onclick="prevImg()">Prev Img</button>
    <img src="../../img/js-sololearn-1.jpg" alt=pic1" id="image" width="300px" height="150px">
    <button onclick="nextImg()">Next Img</button>
</div>
<br/>
<h2>8. Form Validation</h2>
<p>
    For example, let's create a form with two inputs and one button. The text in both fields should be
    the same and not blank to pass the validation.
</p>
<form onsubmit="return validate()" method="post">
    Number: <input type="text" name="num1" id="value1"/> Repeat:
    <input type="text" name="num2" id="value2"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
</form>
