<h2>1. Introducing Objects</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript variables are containers for data values. <b>Objects</b> are variables too, but they can
    contain many values.
</p>
<p>
    Think of an object as a list of values that are written as <b>name:value</b> pairs, with the names
    and the values separated by colons.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> A sample object is created in the browser's console. <br/>
    <b>Note:</b> access object properties in the browser's console.
</p>
<p>
    The given class represents a cuboid (e.g. a rectangular prism) that contains the properties of
    length, width, and height. Complete the program to calculate and output the volume of given cuboid to
    the console.
</p>
<p>
    length: 10<br/>
    height: 13<br/>
    width: 7<br/>
    The volume of the cuboid is: <b><span id="sp1"></span></b>
</p>

<br/>
<h2>2. The Object Constructor</h2>
<p>
    In the examples above, we created an object using the <b>object literal</b> (or initializer) syntax.
    <br/>
    Sometimes, we need to set an "object type" that can be used to create a number of objects of a single
    type. <br/>
    The standard way to create an "object type" is to use an <b>object constructor</b> function.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> Check the browser's console for the created objects using object constructor fucntion
</p>
<p>
    Bob was hired as an airport information officer and needs to generate status messages for each
    flight․ Let’s help him! Complete the given program by fixing the constructor, making a flight object,
    and assign it to given variable to correctly execute the corresponding message. Flight ID and the
    flight status(landed, on time, delayed, etc.) are taken as input.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sample Input:</b> <br/>
    NGT 929 <br/>
    Landed
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sample Output</b> <br/>
    <span id="sp2"></span>
</p>

<br/>
<h2>3. Adding Methods</h2>
<p>Methods are functions that are stored as object properties.</p>
<p>
    A method is a function, belonging to an object. It can be referenced using the <b>this</b> keyword.
    <br/>
    The <b>this</b> keyword is used as a reference to the current object, meaning that you can access the
    objects properties and methods using it.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Check the browser's console for a sample of method creation</p>
<p>
    A store manager needs a program to set discounts for products. The program should take the product
    ID, price and discount as input and output the discounted price.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sample Input:</b> <br/>
    LD1493 <br/>
    1700 <br/>
    17%
</p>
<p>
    <b>Sample Output:</b> <br/>
    <span id="sp3"></span> <br/>
    <span id="sp4"></span>
</p>

<br/>
<h2>Example: Contact Manager</h2>
<p>
    You have created the contact object constructor, which has two arguments, name and number. <br/>
    You need to add a print() method to the object, which will output the contact data to the console in
    the following format: name: number <br/>
    The given code declares two objects and calls their print() methods.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Check the browser's console for the result.</p>
