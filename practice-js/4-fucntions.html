    <h2>1. User-Defined Functions</h2>
    <p>
      The main advantages of using functions: <br />
      Code reuse: Define the code once, and use it many times. Use the same code many times with different
      arguments, to produce different results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating a function that will output "Loading" to the console. <b>Note: </b> Check the browser's
      console to see the result.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>2. Function Parameters</h2>
    <p>
      The program you are given takes an event as input. <br />
      Complete the function-reminder to take that event as argument and output the corresponding message.
      <b>Note: </b> Check the browser's console to see the result.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>3. Using Multiple Parameters with Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Complete the function to take Team 1 and Team 2 goals as arguments and output the final result of the
      match:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="list-style-type: '- '">"Team 1 won", if Team 1's score is higher than Team 2's score</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: '- '">"Team 2 won", if Team 2's score is higher than Team 1's score</li>
      <li style="list-style-type: '- '">"Draw", if the scores are equal</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h2>4. The return Statement</h2>
    <p>
      A function can have an optional return statement. It is used to return a value from the function.
      <br />
      This statement is useful when making calculations that require a result.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function stops executing.</p>
    <p>
      You are given a program that takes 3 numbers as input. <br />
      Complete the given function to calculate the average of those 3 numbers, assign it to the given
      variable, and output it.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>5. Alert, Prompt, Confirm</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript offers three types of popup boxes, the <b>Alert</b>, <b>Prompt</b>, and
      <b>Confirm</b> boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alert box is used when you want to ensure that information gets through to the user. <br />
      A prompt box is often used to have the user input a value before entering a page. <br />
      A confirm box is often used to have the user verify or accept something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entered name in prompt is: <strong><span id="sp1"></span></strong>
    </p>
    <p id="p1"></p>
