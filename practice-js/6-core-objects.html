    <h2>1. Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      The array you are given represents the menu of breakfast options available at the hotel. <br />
      The Chef decided to replace one of the options with "Fluffy Pancakes". <br />
      Write a program to take the index as input, replace the element with that index with "Fluffy
      Pancakes", and output the new menu to the console as an array.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Check the result in browser's console</p>

    <br />
    <h2>2. Other Ways to Create Arrays</h2>
    <p>There are other ways to create arrays. Check the browser's console to see all the methods.</p>
    <p>
      JavaScript arrays are dynamic, so you can declare an array and not pass any arguments with the
      Array() constructor. You can then add the elements dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
      For greater simplicity, readability, and execution speed, you can also declare arrays using the array
      literal syntax.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>3. Array Properties</h2>
    <p>JavaScript's concat() method allows you to join arrays and create an entirely new array.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console to see a sample.</p>

    <br />
    <h2>4. Associative Arrays</h2>
    <p>
      While many programming languages support arrays with named indexes (text instead of numbers), called
      associative arrays JavaScript does not. However, you still can use the named array syntax, which will
      produce an object.
    </p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console to see a sample.</p>

    <br />
    <h2>5. The Math Object</h2>
    <p>The Math object allows you to perform mathematical tasks, and includes several properties.</p>
    <p>Create a function that returns the century depending on the year given as a parameter.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Sample Input:</b> <br />
      1993
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sample Output:</b> <br />
      <span id="sp1"></span>
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>6. The Date Object</h2>
    <p>
      The setInterval() method calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in
      milliseconds).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 60 seconds in a minute, and a timer is designed to count down to the last second :) <br />
      Counting Down: <span id="sp2">60</span>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Date object enables us to work with dates. <br />
      Current Dated: <span id="sp3"></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Other ways to define date: <span id="sp4"></span> <br />
      Other ways to define date: <span id="sp5"></span> <br />
      Other ways to define date: <span id="sp6"></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's create a program that prints the current time to the browser once every second. <br />
      <span id="sp7"></span>
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>Example - The Date Object</h2>
    <p>
      The program you are given takes year, month and day as input. Create a function that takes them as
      arguments and returns the corresponding day of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sample Input: </b> <br />
      1993 <br />
      7 <br />
      24 <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sample Output</b> <br />
      <span id="sp8"></span>
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>Example - Store Manager</h2>
    <p>You are working on a Store Manager program, which stores the prices in an array.</p>
    <p>
      You need to add functionality to increase the prices by the given amount. The increase variable is
      taken from user input. You need to increase all the prices in the given array by that amount and
      output to the console the resulting array.
    </p>
    <p><b>note: </b>Check the prices in the browser's console.</p>
