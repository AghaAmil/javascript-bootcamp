<h2>1. User-Defined Functions</h2>
<p>
    The main advantages of using functions: <br/>
    Code reuse: Define the code once, and use it many times. Use the same code many times with different
    arguments, to produce different results.
</p>
<p>
    Creating a function that will output "Loading" to the console. <b>Note: </b> Check the browser's
    console to see the result.
</p>

<br/>
<h2>2. Function Parameters</h2>
<p>
    The program you are given takes an event as input. <br/>
    Complete the function-reminder to take that event as argument and output the corresponding message.
    <b>Note: </b> Check the browser's console to see the result.
</p>

<br/>
<h2>3. Using Multiple Parameters with Functions</h2>
<p>
    Complete the function to take Team 1 and Team 2 goals as arguments and output the final result of the
    match:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: '- '">"Team 1 won", if Team 1's score is higher than Team 2's score</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: '- '">"Team 2 won", if Team 2's score is higher than Team 1's score</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: '- '">"Draw", if the scores are equal</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<h2>4. The return Statement</h2>
<p>
    A function can have an optional return statement. It is used to return a value from the function.
    <br/>
    This statement is useful when making calculations that require a result.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function stops executing.</p>
<p>
    You are given a program that takes 3 numbers as input. <br/>
    Complete the given function to calculate the average of those 3 numbers, assign it to the given
    variable, and output it.
</p>

<br/>
<h2>5. Alert, Prompt, Confirm</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript offers three types of popup boxes, the <b>Alert</b>, <b>Prompt</b>, and
    <b>Confirm</b> boxes.
</p>
<p>
    An alert box is used when you want to ensure that information gets through to the user. <br/>
    A prompt box is often used to have the user input a value before entering a page. <br/>
    A confirm box is often used to have the user verify or accept something.
</p>
<p>
    The entered name in prompt is: <strong><span id="sp1"></span></strong>
</p>
<p id="p1"></p>
