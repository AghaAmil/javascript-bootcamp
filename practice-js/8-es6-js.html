<h2>1. ES6 Variables & Strings</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>var: </b>defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>let: </b>allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or
        expression in which they are used.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>const: </b>const variables have the same scope as variables declared using let. The difference is
        that const variables are immutable - they are not allowed to be reassigned.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console log to check the result of variables difference.</p>
<br/>
<p>
    <b>Template literals</b> are a way to output variables in the string. Prior to ES6 we had to break the
    string.
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console log to check the result of variables difference.</p>
<br/>
<h2>2. Loop & Functions in ES6</h2>
<h3>Loops in ECMAScript 6</h3>
<p>
    In JavaScript we commonly use the for loop to iterate over values in a list: <br/>
    The for...in loop is intended for iterating over the enumerable keys of an object. <br/>
    The for...of loop works for other iterable objects as well, including strings
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console log to check the result of variables difference.</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b> <br/>
    Students need to score at least 70 points to pass an exam. The given program declares an array with
    results. Write a program to count and output to the console the number of students who pass the exam.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Students Scores: </b> [68,95,54,84,77,75,63,74,69,80,71,63,56,91,56,56,70,93,65,64,35,68.76,91]
    <br/>
    <b>Result: </b> <span id="sp1"></span>
</p>
<br/>
<h3>Functions in ECMAScript 6</h3>
<p>
    ES6 introduces a new syntax for writing functions. Let's apply it to all functions in this course.
    <br/>
    This new syntax is quite handy when you just need a simple function with one argument. You can skip
    typing function and return, as well as some parentheses and braces. <br/>
    The syntax is very useful for inline functions. For example, let's say we have an array, and for each
    element of the array we need to execute a function.
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console log to check the result of variables difference.</p>
<br/>
<h2>3. ES6 Objects</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript variables can be Object data types that contain many values called properties. <br/>
    An object can also have properties that are function definitions called methods for performing actions
    on the object. <br/>
    ES6 introduces shorthand notations and computed property names that make declaring and using objects
    easier to understand.
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console log to check the result of variables difference.</p>
<p>
    When creating an object by using duplicate property names, the last property will overwrite the prior
    ones of the same name.
</p>
<h3>Computed Property Names</h3>
<p>
    With ES6, you can now use computed property names. Using the square bracket notation [], we can use an
    expression for a property name, including concatenating strings. This can be useful in cases where we
    want to create certain objects based on user data (e.g. id, email, and so on).
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Check the browser's console log for some samples.</p>
<h3>Object.assign()</h3>
<p>
    ES6 adds a new Object method assign() that allows us to combine multiple sources into one target to
    create a single new object.
</p>
<p>Object.assign() is also useful for creating a duplicate of an existing object.</p>
