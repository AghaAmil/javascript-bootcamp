    <h2>1. ES6 Variables & Strings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>var: </b>defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function
        regardless of block scope
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>let: </b>allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the
        block, statement, or expression in which they are used.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>const: </b>const variables have the same scope as variables declared using let.
        The difference is that const variables are immutable - they are not allowed to be
        reassigned.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Note: </b>Check the brower's console log to check the result of varialbes
      difference.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>Template literals</b> are a way to output variables in the string. Prior to ES6
      we had to break the string.
    </p>

      <b>Note: </b>Check the brower's console log to check the result of varialbes
      difference.
