    <h2>1. ES6 Variables & Strings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>var: </b>defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>let: </b>allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or
        expression in which they are used.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>const: </b>const variables have the same scope as variables declared using let. The difference is
        that const variables are immutable - they are not allowed to be reassigned.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Check the brower's console log to check the result of varialbes difference.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>Template literals</b> are a way to output variables in the string. Prior to ES6 we had to break the
      string.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Loop & Functions in ES6</h2>
    <h3>Loops in ECMAScript 6</h3>
    <p>
      In JavaScript we commonly use the for loop to iterate over values in a list: <br />
      The for...in loop is intended for iterating over the enumerable keys of an object. <br />
      The for...of loop works for other iterable objects as well, including strings
    </p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Check the brower's console log to check the result of varialbes difference.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Example:</b> <br />
      Students need to score at least 70 points to pass an exam. The given program declares an array with
      results. Write a program to count and output to the console the number of students who pass the exam.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Students Scores: </b> [68,95,54,84,77,75,63,74,69,80,71,63,56,91,56,56,70,93,65,64,35,68.76,91]
      <br />
      <b>Result: </b> <span id="sp1"></span>
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Functions in ECMAScript 6</h3>
    <p>
      ES6 introduces a new syntax for writing functions. Let's apply it to all functions in this course.
      <br />
      This new syntax is quite handy when you just need a simple function with one argument. You can skip
      typing function and return, as well as some parentheses and braces. <br />
      The syntax is very useful for inline functions. For example, let's say we have an array, and for each
      element of the array we need to execute a function.
    </p>
